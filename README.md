# landing-page

Hello, everyone! 

Welcome to the README file for my landing page. This is the final project for the CSS portion of The Odin Project. 

Let's see what I have learned thus far and hopefully make this page pretty!

Stay tuned for more updates...

Update-1:

I just completed the landing-page project and it took a lot longer than expected! After the first run through, I decided to start over and try again. This time I created a "landing-page-sections" image that breaks down each portion of the webpage into respective sections. This image is located within /img if you are interested in seeing what I came up with.

Update-2:

Obviously the webpage looks horrible on Mobile and, at this moment, I have not yet learned how to implement Responsive Layouts. This will come later down the road and for now you will just have to enjoy the awesome Desktop version of the webpage :)
