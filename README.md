# landing-page

Hello, everyone! 

Welcome to the README file for my landing page. This is the final project for the CSS portion of The Odin Project. 

Let's see what I have learned thus far and hopefully make this page pretty!

Stay tuned for more updates...

Update-1:

I just completed the landing-page project and it took a lot longer than expected! After the first run through, I decided to start over and try again. This time I created a "landing-page-sections" image that breaks down each portion of the webpage into respective sections. This image is located within /img if you are interested in seeing what I came up with.
